Hi there! 

I'm an iOS developer based in Tokyo.  In my previous life, I worked as a Business Analyst in my home state of Hawaii.  I'm passionate about learning new technologies and expanding my knowledge on app development.  I learned iOS development from  <a href="https://codetechniq.com/" target="_blank">CodeTechniq</a> and through rigorous self-studying.
